# Introduction

The classification and counting of vehicles using deep learning is crucial in transportation management, traffic monitoring, and urban planning. This research focuses on developing a deep learning-based approach for real-time vehicle classification and counting from video or image data.

This detection has become an active research area of computer vision and image processing, AI, communication system to attract new researchers nowadays. We are going to use Yolo V8 algorithm, convolution neural networks to detect the number of vehicles and the type of vehicles on roads.

#  Objective of the Project

The main objective of our project is to detect and classify the number of vehicles.

To make the traffic analysis easier

To classify the vehicles based on the type of vehicles using deep learning

# Motivation and contribution of work

Vehicle detection system is a solution that automates the process of vehicle detection and classification.

Recent years have seen tremendous growth in practically every field and the transportation sector is no exemption to this.

With each year seeing an increase in the number of vehicles on the road, road traffic accidents are also on an all-time high, and road safety is perhaps more important than ever.

So, what is an effective method to monitor road traffic, prevent accidents and keep transportation systems running as efficiently as possible.

# Proposed System

We are using deep learning method to process the input image, where the input of our system will be the vehicles on roads.

Our algorithm is based on deep learning technologies, particularly convolutional neural networks and neural network modelling.(YOLO V8)

Our proposed system will detect, classify and count the number of vehicles.

 So, our system is an effective method to monitor road traffic, prevent accidents and keep transportation systems running as efficiently as possible.
