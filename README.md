INTRODUCTION:
The classification and counting of vehicles using deep learning is crucial in transportation management, traffic monitoring, and urban planning. This research focuses on developing a deep learning-based approach for real-time vehicle classification and counting from video or image data.

This detection has become an active research area of computer vision and image processing, AI, communication system to attract new researchers nowadays. We are going to use Yolo V8 algorithm, convolution neural networks to detect the number of vehicles and the type of vehicles on roads.
